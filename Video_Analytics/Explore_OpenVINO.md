## Explore  OpenVINO™ toolkit Samples
### Introduction
The OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and Solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Toolkit extends computer vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance.
### The OpenVINO™ toolkit:
- Enables the CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge.
- Supports heterogeneous execution across Intel's computer vision accelerators, using a common API for the CPU, Intel® Integrated Graphics, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick, and FPGA. However, we are not covering Intel® Movidius™ and FPGA in this lab.
- Speeds time-to-market through an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels.
- Includes optimized calls for computer vision standards, including OpenCV, OpenCL™, and OpenVX™

### Pre-requisites

### Running the Sample Programs
#### Security Barrier Camera Sample                         
**Description**                           
Showcase Vehicle Detection, followed by Vehicle Attributes and License Plate Recognition are applied on top of Vehicle Detection. The vehicle attributes execution barrier reports the general vehicle attributes, like the vehicle type and colour, whether the type is something like car, van, or bus.
The application reads command line parameters and loads the specified models. The Vehicle/License-Plate Detection model is required, and the others are optional.

**Build and Run Sample with CPU**
1. **Type *command prompt* in the search box on the taskbar.**
2. **Click the *Command Prompt* result**
3. **Navigate to the OpenVINO demo folder in your command prompt window:**
```
cd C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk_2018.3.343\deployment_tools\demo
```
4. **Execute the following command to run the security barrier camera demo**
```
demo_security_barrier_camera.bat
```

- **Output and Performance**
The output uses OpenCV to display the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes and text with vehicle attributes, license plate, detection time and frames per second (fps). The inference was done using a pre-trained model on **CPU**.

**Building All Samples**
1. **Click the File Explorer shortcut on the taskbar**
2. **Navigate to `C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk_2018.3.343\deployment_tools\inference_engine\samples\build_2017`**
3. **Double click the samples.sln file to open it in Visual Studio 2017**
4. **Right click security_barrier_camera_sample > Build**
- Upon successful build, a security_barrier_camera_sample.exe file is available inside the C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk_2018.3.343\deployment_tools\inference_engine\bin\intel64\Debug folder.

5. **Navigate to the Debug folder in your Command Prompt window:**
```
cd C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk_2018.3.343\deployment_tools\inference_engine\bin\intel64\Debug

```
- **Output and Performance**
The output uses OpenCV to display the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes and text with vehicle attributes, license plate, detection time and frames per second (fps). The inference was done using a pre-trained model on **CPU**.

Next, we repeat the exercise with **GPU** and observe the performance.
